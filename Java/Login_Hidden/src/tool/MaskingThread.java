    Synchronization in Java is possible by using Java keywords synchronized and volatile and locks.
   In Java, we can not have synchronized variable. Using synchronized keyword with a variable is illegal and will result in compilation error. 
   Instead of using the synchronized variable in Java, you can use the java volatile variable, 
   which will instruct JVM threads to read the value of volatile variable from main memory and donâ€™t cache it locally.
   If a variable is not shared between multiple threads then there is no need to use the volatile keyword.
