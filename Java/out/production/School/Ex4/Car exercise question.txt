Lvl. 1: Creating classes and objects

1)	You are writing a code for a car rental company. 
Create a class to represent a car in your company. 
Each car has a name, and a daily rental price. 
The user should be able to retrieve the carâ€™s name and its daily price. 
In addition, a user can ask the total price to rent the car for X days. 
See example of the main below

public class CarRental{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Car car1 = new Car("Volvo", 210.50);
		Car car2 = new Car("Ferrari", 550.00);
		
		System.out.println(car1.getName()+" costs "+car1.getDailyPrice()+
                               " SEKs per day.");
		System.out.println(car2.getName()+" costs "+car2.getDailyPrice()+
                               " SEKs per day.");
		
		int days = 5; //this indicates how many days you will rent the car.
		System.out.println(car1.getName()+" costs "+car1.calculateRent(days)+
                               " SEKs for "+days+" day.");
	}
}
